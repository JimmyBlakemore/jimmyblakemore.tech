        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>Hey! I'm <strong class="name">Jimmy</strong>, a web developer with a flair for the extraordinary.</p>
        <img src="image.png" alt="" class="profile-photo">
        <p>A '92 baby with a
            Gen
            X upbringing, I'm all about channeling the essence of the 90s into the digital realm.</p>
        <img src="90s-dexter.gif" alt="" class="gif">
        <p>Beyond the code, my journey is painted with words. Armed with a BA in creative writing and English from
            Southern
            New Hampshire University, and currently pursuing an MFA in creative writing, I've seamlessly blended the
            art
            of storytelling with the precision of web development.</p>
        <img src="monday-typing-monkey.gif" alt="" class="gif">
        <p>Imagine a digital space that pulsates with the energy of the 90sâ€”bold, dynamic, and utterly
            unforgettable.
            That's the experience I'm here to craft. Each line of code is a stroke on the canvas of nostalgia, where
            websites aren't just viewed; they're experienced.</p>
        <img src="aol-america.gif" alt="" class="gif">
        <p>Join me on this digital escapade where creativity and code converge. Together, let's resurrect the spirit
            of
            the 90s and redefine the landscape of web design.</p>
